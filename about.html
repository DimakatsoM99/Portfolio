  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Dimakatso Mokhomo</p>
  <p>I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic software developer with a strong passion for creating beautiful, user-centric applications that drive meaningful impact. Specializing in full-stack development, I thrive at the intersection of design and technology — blending creativity, problem-solving, and precision to craft solutions that are both functional and intuitive.</p>

  <p>My journey into software development is deeply influenced by my diverse background in sports, education, and community engagement, which has instilled in me the values of teamwork, empathy, and purpose-driven work. Whether I’m building a scalable web application, collaborating across disciplines, or mentoring others, I approach each challenge with clarity, adaptability, and a user-first mindset.</p>

  <p>I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and designing seamless user experiences that solve real-world problems. From back-end architecture to front-end finesse, I bring a holistic approach to development — always guided by curiosity, continuous learning, and a desire to make technology more accessible and impactful.</p>

  <p>Above all, I'm motivated by the opportunity to contribute to projects that uplift, connect, and empower others</p>
